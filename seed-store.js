const LETTER002=`Lizzy,

I think one of the funniest things about getting to know someone is that eventually you start remembering things you never actually tried to remember.

Just little things.

The things you like. The things that annoy you. The way you react to certain jokes. The things I know are going to earn me a look before I've even finished saying them.

Somehow I've collected a ridiculous amount of Lizzy information.

I know you love pink — apparently every possible shade of it.

I know pasta has a suspiciously strong position in your life.

I know there are approximately seventeen different versions of you depending on the situation.

There's Lizzy.
There's Mabebeza.
There's Agent Yelizaveta.
There's Little Miss Attitude — who, for legal reasons, I will not comment on further.

And then there's the version of you that laughs when you're trying very hard not to give me the satisfaction of knowing I made you laugh.

That's probably one of my favourites.

I also notice how much you enjoy crying.

At this point, I refuse to believe it is accidental. It appears to be one of your hobbies. 😂

I know you will try to tell me it's “cleansing,” a “detox,” an “emotional release,” or whatever propaganda you decide to give me that day.

LizzyOS Intelligence remains unconvinced.

As far as this investigation is concerned, you simply enjoy a good cry and have developed excellent PR around it.

But it's not really the big things I've enjoyed learning.

It's the random little details.

The things you mention once that somehow stay in my head.

The conversations that weren't supposed to be important but become things I remember anyway.

The jokes that go on for far longer than they should.

Even the arguments where I'm obviously right and you require a little extra time to realise it.

(Please don't close the letter.)

And somewhere along the way, all those little things started becoming part of this ridiculous world we've created.

That's probably what LizzyOS really is when you remove all the missions, Micky Bucs, classified documents, Reverse Tokens, Batman sightings and highly questionable financial institutions.

It's just a collection of little things I've remembered about you.

And apparently I cared enough about those little things to turn them into an entire operating system.

Which, now that I've written it down, sounds slightly insane.

Anyway.

There isn't some massive secret hidden at the end of this letter.

I just wanted you to know that I notice you.

Probably more than you realise.

And I really like the person I've been getting to know.

Even Little Miss Attitude.

Occasionally.

— Mikael
a.k.a. Mr Perfect 😌

P.S. If you paid an unreasonable amount of Micky Bucs for this letter, please direct all refund requests to the Bank of Micky.

They will be ignored.`;
const DOSSIER001=`LIZZYOS INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
CASE: #001-YEL — INITIAL SUBJECT ASSESSMENT
CLASSIFICATION: CONFIDENTIAL 🔴

SUBJECT: Lebone Elizabeth Kganyago
CODENAME: Agent Yelizaveta
KNOWN ALIASES: Lizzy, Little Miss Attitude, Mabebeza, Four Eyes
INVESTIGATING OFFICER: Agent Mikhail Petrov

PURPOSE OF FILE:
Establish an initial intelligence profile for the individual who somehow became important enough to require an entire operating system.

PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

01 — INTELLIGENCE
Subject is smart, opinionated and very capable of forming her own conclusions.
Operational downside: she frequently uses these abilities to disagree with Mikael.

02 — ATTITUDE
Levels fluctuate between reasonable and Little Miss Attitude.
Estimated attitude capacity: Extremely high.
Likelihood of admitting this assessment is accurate: Low.

03 — COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR
Subject has demonstrated suspicious confidence during competitive activities.
Bowling threat level: HIGH.
Mikael survival probability: Under review.

04 — PERSONAL INTERESTS
Pink appears to have achieved near-total control of the subject's colour preferences.
Pasta remains a strategically important food group.

05 — MIKAEL TOLERANCE
Despite repeated exposure to Mikael's jokes, unnecessary confidence, Batman behaviour and Mr Perfect propaganda, the subject continues to communicate with him.
Investigators consider this statistically unusual.

BEHAVIOURAL SUMMARY
Kindness: High
Intelligence: High
Attitude: Also high
Competitive instinct: Dangerous
Ability to make Mikael laugh: Confirmed
Ability to argue: Elite
Tolerance for nonsense: Higher than expected
Likelihood of becoming the subject of additional classified files: 100%

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
Agent Yelizaveta is officially classified as:
HIGH VALUE • HIGH ATTITUDE • REQUIRES CONTINUED OBSERVATION

CASE STATUS: OPEN 🔐

NOTE FROM INVESTIGATING OFFICER:
This was supposed to be one file.
That plan has already failed.`;

CASE: #002-H8R — THE HATER INVESTIGATION
CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET 🔴
SUBJECT: Agent Yelizaveta
ALIAS: Little Miss Attitude
INVESTIGATING OFFICER: Agent Mikhail Petrov

LizzyOS has detected an unusually high level of hater activity originating from Agent Yelizaveta. Following numerous suspicious comments, questionable opinions and completely unnecessary attacks on Mikael, a formal investigation was launched.

Subject has also openly expressed a general dislike of men. This raises an important question: How did Mikael somehow survive the selection process?

OFFICIAL CHARGES
01 — Unprovoked Mikael Slander. GUILTY.
02 — Excessive Attitude. VERY GUILTY.
03 — Being a Professional Hater. GUILTY WITH DISTINCTION. 🏆
04 — Refusing to Admit When Mikael Is Right. GUILTY.
05 — The Mr Perfect Incident. Evidence confirms that “Mr Perfect” originated from the subject herself. EXTREMELY GUILTY. 😌

BEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENT
Hater Level: 98%
Attitude: 97%
Stubbornness: [SYSTEM OVERLOAD]
Ability to argue: Elite
Likelihood of admitting Mikael is right: 2%
Likelihood of arguing with this report: 100%

FINAL VERDICT: GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS.
SENTENCE: Continued association with Mikael. No possibility of parole. 😂

CASE STATUS: CLOSED*
*Subject will almost certainly provide enough evidence to reopen this investigation.*`;
const DOSSIER003=`LIZZYOS SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT
CASE: #003-MP — OPERATION: MR PERFECT
CLASSIFICATION: ULTRA SECRET 🔴

Agent Yelizaveta referred to Mikhail as “MR PERFECT.” This was not a nickname created by Mikael. It came directly from Lizzy herself.

CENTRAL QUESTION:
Why would a woman with such a well-documented history of hating men willingly give one of them the title Mr Perfect?

THEORY #001 — Temporary Loss of Judgement
Probability: 8%.

THEORY #002 — Sarcasm
LizzyOS ruling: BORING. NEXT THEORY.

THEORY #003 — THE DANCE INCIDENT 🕺🏾
Intelligence reports indicate that Agent Mikhail possesses exceptional dancing abilities.
Technique: Incredible
Rhythm: Unmatched
Footwork: World class
Confidence: Possibly excessive
Effect on Agent Yelizaveta: Significant

Investigators believe there is a strong possibility that Mikael's amazing dance skills won her heart. Agent Yelizaveta's objection has already been rejected. 😂

THEORY #004 — She Secretly Thinks Mikael Is Amazing
Exhibit A: She called him Mr Perfect.
Exhibit B: She continues talking to him despite allegedly being a professional hater.
Exhibit C: The aforementioned dancing.
Exhibit D: [REDACTED]
Exhibit E: [REDACTED]
Exhibit F: Why are you still reading this file, Lizzy? 👀

MIKHAIL PETROV ASSESSMENT
Cheekiness: 96%
Confidence: 99%
Dancing: 100% 🕺🏾
Ability to annoy Lizzy: Elite
Actually Perfect: Under investigation
Believes he's perfect: Unfortunately, yes.

CRITICAL CONTRADICTION
FACT ONE: Lizzy hates men.
FACT TWO: Mikael is a man.
FACT THREE: Lizzy called Mikael Mr Perfect.

Leading theory: D — ALL OF THE ABOVE.

CASE STATUS: UNSOLVED 🔐
Denial will be recorded as additional evidence.`;

CONFIDENTIAL CASE FILE

CASE: CODY ALADEEN v. MIKAEL MULAUDZI
CLIENT: Cody Aladeen
LEGAL COUNSEL: Lizzy
STATUS: Counsel has been retained.

NOTICE TO MIKAEL:

This document serves as formal notice that Cody Aladeen is now represented by Lizzy in all present and future disputes involving alleged bullying, suspicious grappling, unnecessary wrestling attempts, intimidation, treat-related disagreements, or comments regarding Cody's grappling ability.

The client would like the record to show that his grappling skills have been assessed as DECENT.

Mikael may disagree with this assessment.
Mikael is strongly advised to keep those disagreements to himself.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
1. Mikael may not test new grappling techniques on Cody without prior approval from legal counsel.
2. Cody retains the right to defend himself using paws, speed, strategic retreat, dramatic staring, or immediate contact with his lawyer.
3. Any attempt by Mikael to claim that he could “probably take Cody” may be used against him in the Court of LizzyOS.
4. Cody is entitled to reasonable access to treats, naps, windows and legal representation.
5. Lizzy reserves the right to introduce additional charges whenever Mikael is being suspicious.

LEGAL RISK ASSESSMENT:
Cody's grappling: Decent.
Cody's legal team: Extremely dangerous.
Mikael's confidence before legal representation: High.
Mikael's confidence after discovering Lizzy is the lawyer: Significantly reduced.

FINAL NOTICE:
Mikael is reminded that fighting someone who can grapple you is one problem.

Fighting someone who can grapple you AND sue you is a completely different administrative situation.

Signed,
Lizzy
Legal Counsel for Cody Aladeen

Filed by: LizzyOS Legal Department
Mikael's objection: DENIED.`;
const LETTER003="Dear Lizzy,\n\nI’ve realised something slightly annoying.\n\nI notice a lot about you.\n\nYour facial expressions when I say something stupid. The way you try not to laugh because apparently admitting Mikael is funny would damage your reputation. How competitive you suddenly become the second there’s a winner and a loser.\n\nI notice your attitude — obviously. I notice when you’re excited, tired, when something is bothering you, and when you're pretending everything is fine.\n\nI notice your smile, your laugh, your glasses and obviously your beauty too. You are very pretty. Like… very pretty. But I’ll try not to mention that too much. Your head is already big enough.\n\nI also notice your “personality.”\n\nYou know…\n\nYour personality.\n\nVery noticeable. Great personality, actually.\n\nMoving on before this investigation becomes inappropriate. 😂\n\nSomehow I remember more of the random things you tell me than you probably realise — even your “crying is a detox” propaganda.\n\nApparently my brain has decided Lizzy information deserves an unreasonable amount of storage.\n\nVery inefficient.\n\nBut I suppose I’ll keep noticing.\n\nEspecially the little things. 💗\n\nMikael\na.k.a. Mr Perfect";
const LETTER004="Dear Lizzy,\n\nI have some unfortunate news.\n\nI’ve gotten used to you.\n\nUsed to talking to you, annoying you, hearing your stories, arguing about nonsense and trying to make you laugh.\n\nI've even gotten used to you doing absolutely everything in your power to ragebait me and generally be a menace to my peace.\n\nSometimes I genuinely believe you wake up and think: How can I irritate Mikael today?\n\nAnd apparently I've accepted this as part of my life now.\n\nSomething funny happens? I want to tell Lizzy. Something ridiculous happens? Lizzy needs to hear this.\n\nAnd then there's the constant bamboozling.\n\nEvery now and then I'll look at you and somehow forget that Four Eyes is actually ridiculously pretty. Beautiful. Stunning. Very, very easy on the eyes.\n\nAnd stuff.\n\nImportant that I add “and stuff” so this letter doesn't become too romantic. We have standards.\n\nSomehow you've become part of what feels normal. When we haven't spoken properly, I notice. When something's wrong with you, I care. And apparently when you're sick, I start writing letters.\n\nThis is getting completely out of hand.\n\nSo no, this is NOT Mikael admitting anything. All evidence is circumstantial. Mr Perfect maintains plausible deniability.\n\nBut unfortunately, Four Eyes…\n\nI've gotten pretty used to having you around.\n\nThe ragebaiting. The menace behaviour. The bamboozling. The beauty and stuff.\n\nAll of it.\n\nAnd I don't particularly want that to change. 💗\n\nMikael\na.k.a. Mr Perfect";

// Same reasoning as the reverse-token poller above: if this tab sits
// backgrounded, suspended, or gets restored from the browser's
// back-forward cache across midnight, the Micky Bucs job board would
// otherwise keep showing yesterday's already-rendered 5 jobs until the
// Seed Store window happens to be reopened. dailyJobs() is already safe
// to call repeatedly — it only regenerates the list when the stored
// date no longer matches today() — so it's cheap to just recheck on
// every resume.
