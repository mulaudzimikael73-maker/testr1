   MizzyGram — Phase 8 (in-app profile editing)
   Everything is stored in this browser (IndexedDB) for now.
   Name / bio / profile picture can now be changed in-app from the
   Profile tab ("✏️ Edit Profile", own profile only) — saved to
   Store's "profile-overrides" meta key and merged onto CONFIG.users
   at boot. Username and personality still require editing CONFIG
   below. Lizzy can no longer switch into Mikael's account from the
   Profile tab — that direction of the switcher is disabled in both
   the UI (button hidden) and switchUser() itself. Mikael switching
   to Lizzy's account is unaffected.
